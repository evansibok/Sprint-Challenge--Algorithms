#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) - While we have assigned a value (constant) to `a` and increment it we still have a body of code that iterates the expression `n` number of times and since we don't put constants into considerations, we have a worst case scenario of `O(n)`.

b) O(n^2) - We've got two loops in this code which runs a total of `n * n` times. This means our worst case scenario is automatically `O(n^2)`.

c) O(n) - Being a recursive function the time taken to execute the function call is `n` and given the amount of operations in the call as 3 `=, +, and -` all being term as constant operations, it's agreeable that we have a worst case scenario of `O(n)`.
